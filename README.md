# Web-Design-Challenge

Let's take a look at the weather on 1/05/17.

The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the Open WeatheMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

After Assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. The site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and description of any trends and correlations witnessed.

Enjoy.
